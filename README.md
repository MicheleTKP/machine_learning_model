# Machine Learning Model

## Overview
This repository compares logistic regression and random forest models on a specific dataset using Python.

## Key Libraries
- pandas
- NumPy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn (sklearn)

## Methodology
1. Data Processing
   - Data cleaning
   - Feature selection

2. Model Building
   - Splitting data into training and test sets
   - Training logistic regression model
   - Training random forest model

3. Model Evaluation
   - Calculating Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Calculating R-squared (R2) score
   - Comparing model performances

5. Visualization
   - Plotting model results
   - Creating comparison charts

# Machine learning model 

## Overview 
This repository provides a comparison of multiple machine learning models to evaluate their performance on a specific dataset. The models compared include logistic regression, random forests, and support vector machines. The analysis is conducted using Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, matplotlib and sklearn.

## Key Libraries
pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
matplotlib: For creating visualizations to display insights from the data, data distributions, correlations, and model results. 
sklearn: To build and evaluate machine learning models such as logistic regression, random forest, suppurt vector machines (SVM). Performance metrics - Mean Squarred Error (MSE) and Root Squared (R2)

## Methodology
Data Processing: Data cleaning and preparation.
Model building: Training the model, applying the model to make predictions and evaluating the model.
Visualization:
